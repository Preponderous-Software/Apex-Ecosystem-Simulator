# Apex
This game allows you to manage a virtual environment containing entities that depend on each other as sources of energy. A food chain arises from the configuration of various entities and their specified diets.

## Types of Living Entities
- Chicken
- Pig
- Cow
- Wolf
- Fox
- Rabbit

Each of these attempt to gain energy and reproduce. At the bottom of the food chain is Grass, which chickens, pigs, cows and rabbits are able to eat.

If there is no grass, everything collapses. 

## How does grass respawn?
Living entities spawn excrement when their energy needs are met and this turns into grass over time.
